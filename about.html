    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I'm Westyn Hilliard, a data scientist with a strong passion for solving complex problems through technology. With a Master’s in Data Science, I have had the opportunity to work on numerous projects that leverage data to uncover insights and create impactful solutions.</p>
         
    <p>I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Data Science, where I honed my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and predictive analytics. In my career, I’ve been fortunate to work in finance, where I use data science to drive analytical decisions that improve operations and grow the business.</p>

    <p>What excites me the most about data science is its ability to turn raw data into meaningful stories that influence real-world outcomes. My approach blends creativity with precision, as I strive to balance innovative thinking with a structured mindset to deliver accurate and actionable insights.</p>

    <p>Outside of my professional life, I’m passionate about continuous learning and applying it in real-world contexts. I love staying current with the latest industry trends, refining my programming skills, and enjoying the outdoors in East Tennessee. You can often find me playing pickleball or spending quality time with my family.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to connect or discuss potential opportunities, feel free to reach out!</p>
